	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>How I started do that ..</h3>
			<p>It all started with a banal Windows Paint when I needed to minimally edit the photo in my years of study . 
</p>

			<p>Subsequently, having bought a simple camera, I realized that taking and editing photos is not only my hobby but something more. Paint of course, was not able to meet my requirements, and I found a lot of interesting programs such as Canva, AdobePhotoshop, Vsco and others. Having tried myself in them, I felt that I could help people with photo processing or restoration of old and damaged photos.</p>

			<p>I also have the skills to create business cards, postcards, calendars and various trifles.
Call for help, I'm glad to help You!</p>

			<h3>Design Inspiration </h3>
			<p><h4>Strong inspiration works wonders.</h4> 
				What is an inspiration? I believe that the inspiration to create something comes with music, with a beautiful panorama of the window, with bird tweets, with all the earthly beauty. <br> Inspiration sometimes comes when you visit beautiful and interesting web-sites <br>
			There are some web-sites that I recommend </p>


			<p>-  <a href="behance.net " title="Inspiration site 1 ">Behance</a> <br>
